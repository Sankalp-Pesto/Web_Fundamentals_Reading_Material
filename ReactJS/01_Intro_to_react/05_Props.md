# Tutorial: Understanding ReactJS Props with Examples

In this tutorial, you'll dive into the world of ReactJS props using examples inspired by popular superheroes. Props, short for "properties," allow you to pass data from one component to another in your React application. We'll start with the basics and gradually explore more advanced concepts.


## Step 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Create a new directory for your React app:

   ```bash
   mkdir react-props-tutorial
   cd react-props-tutorial
   ```

3. Initialize a new Node.js project:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

## Step 2: Installing React and React DOM

1. Install React and React DOM packages:

   ```bash
   npm install react react-dom
   ```

## Step 3: Creating Components with Props

In this step, we'll create a simple superhero-themed React app to demonstrate the use of props.

1. Create a new file named `Superhero.js` in your project directory.

2. Open `Superhero.js` and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Superhero(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{props.name}</h2>
      <p>Alias: {props.alias}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Superhero;
```

## Step 4: Using Props in Your App

1. Create a new file named `App.js` in the same directory.

2. Open `App.js` and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Superhero from './Superhero';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Superhero Squad</h1>
      <Superhero name="Iron Man" alias="Tony Stark" />
      <Superhero name="Spider-Man" alias="Peter Parker" />
      <Superhero name="Black Widow" alias="Natasha Romanoff" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Step 5: Running Your React App

1. Create an HTML file named `index.html` in your project directory.

2. Open `index.html` and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>React Props Tutorial</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

3. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to your project directory.

4. Start your development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a list of superheroes along with their aliases.

## Props Destructuring

In this section, we'll explore more advanced prop concepts.

1. Modify the `Superhero.js` component as follows:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Superhero({ name, alias, power }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>Alias: {alias}</p>
      <p>Power: {power}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Superhero;
```

2. Update the `App.js` component to include the new prop:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Superhero from './Superhero';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Superhero Squad</h1>
      <Superhero name="Iron Man" alias="Tony Stark" power="Genius-level intellect and powered armor suit" />
      <Superhero name="Spider-Man" alias="Peter Parker" power="Agility, wall-crawling, and web-shooters" />
      <Superhero name="Black Widow" alias="Natasha Romanoff" power="Master spy and martial artist" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Congratulations, You've Mastered React Props!
