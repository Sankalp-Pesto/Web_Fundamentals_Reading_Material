# Tutorial: Creating Your First ReactJS App

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create your first ReactJS application . We will guide you through the process step by step, starting from setting up your development environment to building a simple app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

1. Node.js: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Create a new directory for your React app:

   ```bash
   mkdir avengers-react-app
   cd avengers-react-app
   ```

3. Initialize a new Node.js project:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

## Step 2: Install React and React DOM

1. Install React and React DOM packages:

   ```bash
   npm install react react-dom
   ```

## Step 3: Create Your React Component

1. Create a new file named `AvengersApp.js` in your project directory.

2. Open `AvengersApp.js` in your preferred code editor and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function AvengersApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Avengers Assemble!</h1>
      <p>Earth's Mightiest Heroes</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default AvengersApp;
```

## Step 4: Create Your React App Entry Point

1. Create a new file named `index.js` in the same directory.

2. Open `index.js` and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import AvengersApp from './AvengersApp';

ReactDOM.render(<AvengersApp />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Step 5: Create HTML Template

1. Create an HTML file named `index.html` in your project directory.

2. Open `index.html` and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Avengers React App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 6: Running Your React App

1. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to your project directory.

2. Start your development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should see your Avengers-themed React app!

## Congratulations! You've Created Your First React App!

You've successfully created your first React app . You've learned how to set up your development environment, create React components, and render them in a web browser. Feel free to customize and expand your app by adding more components, styles, and features inspired by the Avengers universe!
