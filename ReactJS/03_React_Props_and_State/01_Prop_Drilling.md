# Tutorial: Understanding Prop Drilling in React

In this tutorial, you will explore the concept of prop drilling in React using examples inspired by the world of superheroes. Prop drilling refers to the process of passing data through multiple layers of nested components. We'll start with the basics and gradually dive into more advanced scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

1. Node.js: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Create a new directory for your React app:

   ```bash
   mkdir prop-drilling-tutorial
   cd prop-drilling-tutorial
   ```

3. Initialize a new Node.js project:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

## Step 2: Installing React and React DOM

1. Install React and React DOM packages:

   ```bash
   npm install react react-dom
   ```

## Step 3: Creating Nested Components

In this step, you'll create a nested superhero-themed component structure to demonstrate prop drilling.

1. Create a new file named `SuperheroDetails.js` in your project directory.

2. Open `SuperheroDetails.js` and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function SuperheroDetails(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{props.name}</h2>
      <p>Alias: {props.alias}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default SuperheroDetails;
```

## Step 4: Implementing Prop Drilling

1. Create a new file named `Team.js` in the same directory.

2. Open `Team.js` and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import SuperheroDetails from './SuperheroDetails';

function Team(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Superhero Team</h1>
      <SuperheroDetails name="Iron Man" alias="Tony Stark" />
      <SuperheroDetails name="Spider-Man" alias="Peter Parker" />
      <SuperheroDetails name="Black Widow" alias="Natasha Romanoff" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Team;
```

## Step 5: Prop Drilling Scenario

Now, let's create a scenario where we need to pass data from a deeply nested component.

1. Create a new file named `App.js` in the same directory.

2. Open `App.js` and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Team from './Team';

function App() {
  const mission = 'Defend the city';
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Avengers Headquarters</h1>
      <Team mission={mission} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Step 6: Running Your React App

1. Create an HTML file named `index.html` in your project directory.

2. Open `index.html` and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Prop Drilling Tutorial</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

3. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to your project directory.

4. Start your development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the Avengers headquarters with the superhero team and their mission.

## Advanced Scenario: Solving Prop Drilling with Context

In this section, we'll explore how to use Context API to avoid prop drilling.

1. Create a new file named `MissionContext.js` in your project directory.

2. Open `MissionContext.js` and add the following code:

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

const MissionContext = createContext();

export function useMission() {
  return useContext(MissionContext);
}

export function MissionProvider({ children, mission }) {
  return (
    <MissionContext.Provider value={mission}>
      {children}
    </MissionContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

3. Update `App.js`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Team from './Team';
import { MissionProvider } from './MissionContext';

function App() {
  const mission = 'Defend the city';
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Avengers Headquarters</h1>
      <MissionProvider mission={mission}>
        <Team />
      </MissionProvider>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

4. Update `Team.js`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import SuperheroDetails from './SuperheroDetails';
import { useMission } from './MissionContext';

function Team() {
  const mission = useMission();
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Mission: {mission}</h2>
      <h1>Superhero Team</h1>
      <SuperheroDetails name="Iron Man" alias="Tony Stark" />
      <SuperheroDetails name="Spider-Man" alias="Peter Parker" />
      <SuperheroDetails name="Black Widow" alias="Natasha Romanoff" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Team;
```
