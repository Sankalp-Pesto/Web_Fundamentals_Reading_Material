# Tutorial: Function Components in React

Welcome to the tutorial on Function Components in React. In this tutorial, we will introduce you to function components, explain how they work, provide a sample code for creating a function component, and highlight their advantages in React development.

## What are Function Components?

Function components are a type of component in React that are defined as JavaScript functions. They are used to build UI elements and encapsulate their behavior and rendering logic.

## Sample Function Component Code

Here's an example of a simple function component in React:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

In this code, we've defined a function component named `Greeting` that takes a `name` prop and displays a greeting message.

## Advantages of Function Components

1. **Simplicity:** Function components have a simpler syntax compared to class components, making them easier to read and write.

2. **Performance:** Function components typically have better performance than class components due to the absence of the overhead introduced by lifecycle methods.

3. **Hooks:** Function components are the primary target for using React Hooks, which provide a way to use state, context, and other React features without writing class components.

4. **Easier Testing:** Function components are easier to test because they are just JavaScript functions. You can test the rendering logic without needing to deal with lifecycle methods.

5. **Component Composition:** Function components are more suited for composing components together and building a hierarchy of components.

## Summary:

- Function components are defined as JavaScript functions in React.
- They are used to create UI elements and encapsulate rendering logic.
- Function components are simpler, have better performance, and are recommended for most use cases.
- React Hooks are primarily used with function components for state management and other functionalities.
- Function components are easier to test and encourage component composition.
