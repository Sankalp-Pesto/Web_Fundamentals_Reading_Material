# Tutorial: Understanding ReactJS Pure Components and Higher-Order Components (HOCs) with Examples

In this tutorial, we will delve into ReactJS concepts of Pure Components and Higher-Order Components (HOCs) using examples inspired by iconic superheroes. We will begin with the basics and gradually explore more advanced concepts to enhance your understanding.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

1. Node.js: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Create a new directory for your React app:

   ```bash
   mkdir react-pure-hoc-tutorial
   cd react-pure-hoc-tutorial
   ```

3. Initialize a new Node.js project:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

## Step 2: Installing React and React DOM

1. Install React and React DOM packages:

   ```bash
   npm install react react-dom
   ```

## Step 3: Creating a Simple Component

To understand Pure Components and HOCs, let's create a simple component.

1. Create a new file named `Hero.js` in your project directory.

2. Open `Hero.js` and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Hero(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{props.name}</h2>
      <p>Alias: {props.alias}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Hero;
```

## Step 4: Creating a Pure Component

1. Create a new file named `PureHero.js` in the same directory.

2. Open `PureHero.js` and add the following code:

```jsx
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react';

class PureHero extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>{this.props.name}</h2>
        <p>Alias: {this.props.alias}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default PureHero;
```

## Step 5: Creating a Higher-Order Component (HOC)

1. Create a new file named `withPower.js` in the same directory.

2. Open `withPower.js` and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const withPower = (WrappedComponent, power) => {
  return (props) => (
    <div>
      <WrappedComponent {...props} />
      <p>Power: {power}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default withPower;
```

## Step 6: Using Components and HOC

1. Create a new file named `App.js` in the same directory.

2. Open `App.js` and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Hero from './Hero';
import PureHero from './PureHero';
import withPower from './withPower';

const IronMan = withPower(Hero, 'Genius-level intellect and powered armor suit');
const SpiderMan = withPower(PureHero, 'Agility, wall-crawling, and web-shooters');

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Superhero Components</h1>
      <Hero name="Iron Man" alias="Tony Stark" />
      <PureHero name="Captain America" alias="Steve Rogers" />
      <IronMan name="Iron Man" alias="Tony Stark" />
      <SpiderMan name="Spider-Man" alias="Peter Parker" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Step 7: Running Your React App

1. Create an HTML file named `index.html` in your project directory.

2. Open `index.html` and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>React Pure Components and HOCs Tutorial</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

3. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to your project directory.

4. Start your development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a list of superheroes and their powers displayed in different ways.

## Congratulations, You've Learned React Pure Components and HOCs!

You've successfully learned about React's Pure Components and Higher-Order Components. You've seen how Pure Components can optimize rendering and how HOCs can add additional functionality to your components. Apply these concepts to create efficient and modular React applications!
