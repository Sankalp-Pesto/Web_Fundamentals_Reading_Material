**HTML and XHTML**

**Introduction:**

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are markup languages used to create and structure content for webpages. HTML is the standard language for creating web documents, while XHTML is a stricter and more XML-compliant version of HTML. In this tutorial documentation, we will learn about the differences between HTML and XHTML, their syntax, and how to use them to build webpages.

**HTML vs. XHTML:**

The key difference between HTML and XHTML lies in their syntax rules and structure. XHTML follows stricter guidelines and requires well-formed XML syntax, which means all elements must be correctly nested and closed with appropriate closing tags. On the other hand, HTML is more lenient and allows for self-closing tags and omitted closing tags in certain cases.

**Understanding HTML and XHTML Syntax:**

**HTML:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
  <p>This is an HTML paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**XHTML:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
  <title>XHTML Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to XHTML</h1>
  <p>This is an XHTML paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Working Example:**

Let's create a working example to demonstrate the differences between HTML and XHTML.

**HTML Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML vs. XHTML</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>HTML Example</h1>
  <p>This is an HTML paragraph with <br> line break.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**XHTML Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
  <title>HTML vs. XHTML</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>XHTML Example</h1>
  <p>This is an XHTML paragraph with <br /> line break.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Summary:**

HTML and XHTML are markup languages used to create and structure content for webpages. While HTML is more lenient and allows for certain shortcuts, XHTML follows stricter XML rules. The main difference lies in their syntax and structure. By understanding the differences between HTML and XHTML, you can create well-formed webpages and choose the appropriate markup language based on your project's needs. Happy coding!
