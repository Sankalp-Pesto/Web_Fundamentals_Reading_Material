**HTML Attributes**

**Introduction:**

HTML attributes are additional information or settings that can be added to HTML elements. They provide extra details about an element and modify its behavior or appearance. In this tutorial documentation, we will explain HTML attributes in simple terms, list different types of attributes, and provide additional resources for further reading.

**HTML Attribute Syntax:**

Attributes are added to HTML elements as name-value pairs within the element's opening tag. The syntax is as follows:

```html
<element_name attribute_name="attribute_value">
```

**HTML Attribute Types:**

There are various types of HTML attributes that can be used to enhance the functionality and presentation of elements. Some common types of attributes include:

1. **Global Attributes:**
   Global attributes can be used with almost any HTML element. They are not specific to any particular element type. Examples include `class`, `id`, `style`, and `title`.

   ```html
   <div class="container" id="main-content" style="color: blue;" title="This is a container"></div>
   ```

2. **Event Attributes:**
   Event attributes allow you to attach JavaScript code to certain events triggered by the element. Examples include `onclick`, `onmouseover`, and `onkeydown`.

   ```html
   <button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>
   ```

3. **Form Attributes:**
   Form attributes are used with form elements (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, etc.) to control their behavior and interaction with the user.

   ```html
   <input type="text" name="username" required>
   ```

4. **Link Attributes:**
   Link attributes are used with anchor elements (`<a>`) to define the destination URL and link behavior.

   ```html
   <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example Website</a>
   ```

5. **Image Attributes:**
   Image attributes are used with the `<img>` element to specify image properties like width, height, and alt text.

   ```html
   <img src="path_to_image.jpg" alt="Image description" width="200" height="150">
   ```

6. **Media Attributes:**
   Media attributes are used with media elements (`<video>`, `<audio>`) to set media-related properties like autoplay, controls, and loop.

   ```html
   <video src="video.mp4" controls autoplay loop></video>
   ```
