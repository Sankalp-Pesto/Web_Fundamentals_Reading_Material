**All HTML Headings**

**Introduction:**

HTML headings are used to create hierarchical titles and headings on web pages. They provide structure and help organize content for better readability. In this documentation, we will explore all the HTML heading types, their syntax, and provide a code snippet including all of them.

**HTML Heading Types:**

There are six heading levels in HTML, ranging from `<h1>` (highest importance) to `<h6>` (lowest importance).

**Syntax:**
```html
<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
```

**Example Code Snippet:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML Headings</title>
</head>
<body>

  <!-- Heading Level 1 -->
  <h1>Main Heading</h1>

  <!-- Heading Level 2 -->
  <h2>Subheading 1</h2>

  <!-- Heading Level 3 -->
  <h3>Sub-subheading 1.1</h3>

  <!-- Heading Level 2 -->
  <h2>Subheading 2</h2>

  <!-- Heading Level 3 -->
  <h3>Sub-subheading 2.1</h3>

  <!-- Heading Level 4 -->
  <h4>Sub-sub-subheading 2.1.1</h4>

  <!-- Heading Level 5 -->
  <h5>Sub-sub-sub-subheading 2.1.1.1</h5>

  <!-- Heading Level 6 -->
  <h6>Sub-sub-sub-sub-subheading 2.1.1.1.1</h6>

</body>
</html>
```

**Comments:**

- `<h1>`: The main heading that represents the highest level of importance on the page. It should be used once per page to define the main topic or title.

- `<h2>`: Subheadings that represent the next level of importance. They can be used to divide content into sections.

- `<h3>`: Sub-subheadings that provide further division and organization within the sections.

- `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`: These headings represent lower levels of importance, with `<h4>` being more important than `<h5>`, and so on.

**Summary:**

HTML headings provide a way to structure and organize content on web pages. By using the appropriate heading levels, you can create a clear hierarchy and improve the readability of your content. Remember that `<h1>` should be used for the main heading, and the other heading levels should follow a logical and hierarchical order.
