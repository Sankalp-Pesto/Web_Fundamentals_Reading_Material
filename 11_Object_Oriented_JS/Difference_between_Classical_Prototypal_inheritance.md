**Definition:**

In JavaScript, inheritance is a mechanism that allows an object to inherit properties and methods from another object. There are two main types of inheritance: classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance.

**Classical Inheritance:**

Classical inheritance is a type of inheritance that follows a class-based approach. It is commonly found in languages like Java and C++. In this model, you create classes as blueprints first, and then you create objects based on those classes. Objects inherit properties and methods from their classes.

**Syntax of Classical Inheritance:**

1. Define a class:

```javascript
class ParentClass {
  constructor() {
    // Constructor code here
  }

  method1() {
    // Method code here
  }

  // More methods and properties can be defined here
}
```

2. Create an object based on the class:

```javascript
const myObject = new ParentClass();
```

**Prototypal Inheritance:**

Prototypal inheritance, on the other hand, is a type of inheritance that follows a prototype-based approach. In this model, objects can inherit directly from other objects. There are no classes involved; instead, objects act as prototypes for other objects, and properties/methods are shared between them.

**Syntax of Prototypal Inheritance:**

1. Create a prototype object:

```javascript
const parentObject = {
  method1() {
    // Method code here
  }

  // More methods and properties can be defined here
};
```

2. Create an object that inherits from the prototype:

```javascript
const myObject = Object.create(parentObject);
```

In this example, `myObject` will inherit properties and methods from `parentObject`.

**Difference:**

The main difference between classical and prototypal inheritance is the approach to inheritance and the presence of classes:

- **Classical Inheritance:** Uses classes as blueprints to create objects with the `new` keyword. Objects are instances of classes, and inheritance occurs through class hierarchies.

- **Prototypal Inheritance:** Objects directly inherit from other objects (prototypes). There are no classes involved, and inheritance happens through the prototype chain.

JavaScript primarily uses prototypal inheritance, although ES6 introduced a class syntax that internally still uses prototypes. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing effective and maintainable code in JavaScript.
