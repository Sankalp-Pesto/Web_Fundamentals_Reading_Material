- Extensive middleware support for various functionalities.
- Widely used and well-documented.
- Great for both beginners and experienced developers.

**Use Cases:**
- Building RESTful APIs.
- Developing single-page applications.
- Rapid prototyping.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Creating a basic Express.js server
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

### Koa.js

**Features:**
- Developed by the creators of Express.js.
- Focuses on modern async programming techniques.
- Smaller codebase and improved error handling.
- Enhanced support for middleware.

**Use Cases:**
- Asynchronous web applications.
- Scalable APIs.
- Projects emphasizing clean code.

### Nest.js
