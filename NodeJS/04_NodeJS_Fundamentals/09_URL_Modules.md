## Mastering URLs: Your Guide to the Node.js URL Module

The URL module in Node.js simplifies working with URLs, making navigation and parsing seamless.

## Key Functions of the Node.js URL Module

### Parsing URLs

The `url.parse()` function parses a URL string and returns an object with its components.

```javascript
// Example of parsing a URL
const url = require('url');

const urlString = 'https://www.example.com:8080/path?query=param';
const parsedUrl = url.parse(urlString, true);

console.log('Parsed URL:', parsedUrl);
```

### Formatting URLs

The `url.format()` function constructs a URL string from URL components.

```javascript
// Example of formatting a URL
const url = require('url');

const urlObj = {
    protocol: 'https',
    hostname: 'www.example.com',
    port: 8080,
    pathname: '/path',
    query: { query: 'param' }
};

const formattedUrl = url.format(urlObj);
console.log('Formatted URL:', formattedUrl);
```

### Resolving URLs

The `url.resolve()` function resolves a relative URL against a base URL.

```javascript
// Example of resolving a URL
const url = require('url');

const baseUrl = 'https://www.example.com';
const relativeUrl = '/path';

const resolvedUrl = url.resolve(baseUrl, relativeUrl);
console.log('Resolved URL:', resolvedUrl);
```

## Summary

In this comprehensive guide, we've explored the Node.js URL module, understanding its significance and practical applications.
