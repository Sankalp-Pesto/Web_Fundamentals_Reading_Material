**Step-by-Step Guide for Deploying a Simple Website to GitHub Pages**

**Introduction:**

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub that allows you to publish your static websites directly from your GitHub repository. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of deploying a simple website, consisting of HTML and CSS files, to GitHub Pages using simple words.

**Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository:**

1. Log in to your GitHub account or create a new one if you don't have one.
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository."
3. Choose a repository name (e.g., "my-website") and make it public (private repositories require a premium account for GitHub Pages hosting).
4. Optionally, you can add a description and initialize the repository with a README file.
5. Click on the "Create repository" button to create the repository.

**Step 2: Upload Your Website Files:**

1. Once the repository is created, click on the "Add file" button and choose "Upload files."
2. Drag and drop your website files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) into the file upload area.
3. After uploading the files, click on the "Commit changes" button to save them to the repository.

**Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages:**

1. Go to your repository's main page.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab, located on the right side of the repository.
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
4. Under the "Source" dropdown, select "main" (or the branch where your website files are located).
5. Click on the "Save" button. GitHub Pages will now be enabled for your repository.

**Step 4: Access Your Deployed Website:**

1. After enabling GitHub Pages, scroll back to the "GitHub Pages" section to find the link to your deployed website.
2. It will be displayed under "Your site is published at" (e.g., https://your-username.github.io/my-website).
3. Click on the link to access your deployed website and see your simple HTML and CSS website live.

**Step 5: Updating Your Website:**

1. To make changes to your website, go back to your local files, update the HTML or CSS as needed, and save the changes.
2. Go back to your GitHub repository and click on the "Add file" button to upload the updated files.
3. Drag and drop the changed files into the file upload area, and click on the "Commit changes" button to save them.
4. The changes will be automatically deployed to your GitHub Pages website, and you can see the updated version by visiting the same link.

**Summary:**

Deploying a simple website consisting of HTML and CSS files to GitHub Pages is a straightforward process. By following this step-by-step guide, you can showcase your web development projects to the world without the need for complex server setups.
