**Introduction:**

Git and GitHub are both widely used in the software development world, but they serve different purposes. Git is a distributed version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. This documentation will explain the definitions of Git and GitHub, when to use each, and highlight their differences in a table format.

**Git:**

- Definition: Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code, manage different versions, and collaborate with others. It runs on a developer's local machine and does not require an internet connection to function.

- When to use Git:
  - Use Git when working on a local project or in a team where all members have direct access to the shared repository.
  - Use Git for version control and tracking changes in code efficiently.

**GitHub:**

- Definition: GitHub is a web-based hosting service that provides a platform for developers to store, manage, and collaborate on Git repositories. It adds an extra layer on top of Git and makes it easier to work with Git repositories remotely.

- When to use GitHub:
  - Use GitHub to host your Git repositories in the cloud and collaborate with other developers worldwide.
  - Use GitHub when you want to share your code with the community, contribute to open-source projects, or showcase your work.

**Differences between Git and GitHub:**

|  **Aspect**           |  **Git**                                           |  **GitHub**                                       |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**        | Git is a distributed version control system.      | GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories. |
| **Location**          | Runs on a developer's local machine.              | Hosted on GitHub's servers accessible through the internet. |
| **Internet Required** | Not required; Git works offline.                  | Requires an internet connection to access and collaborate with remote repositories. |
| **Collaboration**     | Suitable for local collaboration or small teams.  | Facilitates global collaboration with developers worldwide. |
| **Features**          | Provides version control and change tracking.     | Adds features like pull requests, issue tracking, and project management on top of Git. |
| **Privacy**           | Repositories can be kept private or shared.       | Repositories can be public or private, depending on the user's preference. |
| **Backup**            | No automatic backup; relies on local repositories. | GitHub provides a secure backup and redundancy for repositories. |
| **User Interface**    | Command-line interface (CLI) for Git operations.  | Web-based interface with user-friendly features for managing repositories. |

**Summary:**

In summary, Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to manage code changes and collaborate on projects locally. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that extends Git's capabilities by providing cloud hosting and collaboration features for remote repositories. While Git is ideal for local development and small team collaboration, GitHub offers a global platform for open-source contributions and larger community projects. Understanding the differences between Git and GitHub will help you choose the right tool for your development needs and workflow.
